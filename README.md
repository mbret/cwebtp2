## web.xml
The web.xml configuration file is a J2EE configuration file that determines how elements of the HTTP request are processed by the servlet container.
It is not strictly a Struts2 configuration file, but it is a file that needs to be configured for Struts2 to work.

# TODO
- Find a way to share constant var (for example to store the jsp path and use it in action)
- Implement a layout system for jsp (tiles, ...)
- Implement the structure of action /users/detail/{id} /users/detail/{id}/messages with url in jsp
